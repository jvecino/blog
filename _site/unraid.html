<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>unRAID is software for storing and managing digital files on a mass-storage server.  In more technical terms, unRAIDÂ® is an embedded Network Attached Storage (NAS) server operating system.  It was &gt;specifically designed for digital media storage (e.g., videos, photos, music, &amp; movies).</p>

  <p>It allows you to build an array of hard drives and share the data from those drives across the local network &gt;(typically within a house or business).  Importantly, it protects all the data on the drives if one should fail.</p>
